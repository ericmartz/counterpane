        <p>We have 174 scheduled school days in our school-wide calendar. To reach the State of Georgia's requirement for a 180-day school year, six additional days of school are required for each student. Students and families are to choose at least six days of school-designed activities from the list of options scheduled during weekends and school breaks. While several activities are designed for the entire school, others are age-group specific. Please refer to the school calendar for scheduled trips, and be aware that some opportunities arise during the year. You will receive additional information during the school year about day trips and overnights available to your child's classroom community. Family trip attendance counts as school attendance, and while different families may take advantage of different opportunities, a student's absence from any of his or her six chosen family trips will be treated as an absence from school. This policy reflects the philosophy that learning is best when the entire family is engaged. Favorite recurring outings include trips to the Atlanta Science Festival, the Decatur Book Festival, and Cumberland Island. </p>
